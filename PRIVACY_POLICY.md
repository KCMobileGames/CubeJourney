Welcome to the Cube's Journey app for Android!

This is an open source Android app developed by myself. The app will be available on Google Play.

As an avid tech user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information at all. If this changes over time as I submit updates to the app
this privacy policy will be updated accordingly. 

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy,
please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,
Kevin
